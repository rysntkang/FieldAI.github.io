        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>Over the years, emerging interest has occurred in
          integrating computer vision technology into agriculture industry. In this
          project, we sill study one critical problem in this area: counting maize tassels
          in the wild. Accurate counting of maize tassels is important for monitoring the
          growth status of maize plants. But this tedious work is traditionally done via
          manual work. To free humans from such intensive work and increase the
          scalability required for plant analysis, in this project we aim to develop robust
          deep neural network to automatically count the maize tassels.</p>
        <p>The expected outcome will be a system that can automatically read maize
          plant image, predict the maize tassel number, and visualize the counting result.</p>
        <h1>Expected Benefit</h1>
        <p>The developed algorithm is expected to be able to automatically count maize
          tassels in the wild with acceptable accuracy. This will largely reduce the
          human labour and meet the need of large-scale analysis of phenotype in
          agriculture.</p>
